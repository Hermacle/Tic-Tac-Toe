# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Tic Tac Toe in React

This project is designed to help developers learn how to use React to create a simple game. Tic Tac Toe is a classic game that is easy to understand and provides a great opportunity to practice building interactive web applications.

The tutorial provided by React is a great starting point for learning how to build a Tic Tac Toe game in React. This project takes the tutorial one step further by providing a fully functional implementation of the game that can be run locally or deployed to a web server.
